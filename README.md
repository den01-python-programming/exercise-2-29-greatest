# Exercise 2.29 Greatest

Define a method called `greatest` that takes three numbers and returns the greatest of them. If there are multiple greatest values, returning one of them is enough. Printing will take place in the main program.

```python
def greatest(number1, number2, number3):
    # write your code here

def main():
    answer = greatest(2, 7, 9)
    print("Greatest: " + str(answer))
```

The output of the program:

```plaintext
Greatest: 9
```
